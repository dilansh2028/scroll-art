SCROLL ART 1 (STARS)

Scrollart1 is a series of rapidly randomly printed symbols in the terminal, which are supposed to represent stars. 

The process began with testing out how to use random variables to print out different symbols on the terminal. 
After, I decided to add more symbols and try to randomly print each symbol at a different x and y in the terminal.
I then added two methods provided by my teacher to obtain the width of the terminal and use it to control the location
of where each symbol would print depending on the size of the terminal.

SCROLL ART 2 (FOOTBALL)

This ASCII art is made completely by me of an american football and randomly prints at different x coordinates in the terminal.

I started with drawing out how the ASCII art would look on paper, then on google sheets, and created a method to add it into
the project. I first figured out how to print one single football on the terminal, and then used a for loop to randomly decide
where on the terminal each football would be printed, with only 1 per row to create some sort of upward line of footballs.
